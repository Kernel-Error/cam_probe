# cam_probe

**cam_probe** is a defensive research tool by [Sebastian van de Meer](https://www.kernel-error.de).  
It helps you check your **own IP cameras** (in lab or private networks) for **publicly accessible HTTP endpoints** ‚Äî  
for example, unprotected JPG snapshots or MJPEG streams that can be accessed without authentication.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is strictly meant for authorized security testing on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

## üåü Features

- Scans a wide range of common camera URL paths (HTTP/S)
- Detects real image content (JPEG, PNG, MJPEG)
- Multithreaded and fast, with adjustable worker count
- Supports timeout, custom path lists, and custom User-Agent headers
- **No login attempts**, **no RTSP**, and **no exploits**
- Results are stored in structured folders with CSV logs and any found images
